<p style="text-align: center;"><em>A lot of people tend to think that certain myths about real estate are true. Here are the actual truths behind these myths.</em></p>

There are plenty of myths floating around about our real estate market. Some are making comparisons to our market from 10 years ago, while others are just plain wrong. Today we’re trying to clear the air by explaining the truths behind a few of the most common real estate myths in our market:

**1. We’re headed for another housing bubble.** Home prices have appreciated for the last 76 straight months and many areas of the country are at or above their previous home price peaks. This has many worried that we’re headed toward another housing bubble. In reality, the biggest challenge facing today’s market is a lack of homes for sale. Demand is strong as many renters have come off the fence and are searching for their dream homes. Historically, a normal market requires a six-month supply of homes in order for prices to rise with the rate of inflation. There is currently a 4.3-month supply of inventory.&nbsp;

**2. A recession will lead to another housing market crash.** When we’ve seen economic growth for the better part of a decade, a recession can’t be too far off. But what is a recession? It’s essentially a period of temporary economic decline during which trade and industrial activity are reduced for two consecutive quarters. A recession does not equal a housing crisis. The last time we had a recession, it was caused by a housing crisis, but this market is nothing like that one.

**3. There’s an affordability crisis looming.** Rising home prices have many concerned that the average family will no longer be able to afford a home. There are many different affordability indexes that measure different data, so there is a lot of confusion about what affordability really means. The monthly cost of a home is determined by a home’s price and the interest rate on the mortgage used to purchase it. According to Freddie Mac, interest rates have risen from 3.95% in January to 4.59% just last week. The reality is that home appreciation has largely been driven by supply and demand. According to a recent Zillow study, the percentage of median income needed to buy a home in this market is well below the mark reached from 1985 to 2000 or 2006. Interest rates would have to increase to 6% before buying a home would be less affordable than historical norms.&nbsp;

**The bottom line is that there’s a lot of confusing information in today’s real estate market.** If your future plans involve buying or selling, you’ll need a trusted market advisor to guide you and your family through the process.
