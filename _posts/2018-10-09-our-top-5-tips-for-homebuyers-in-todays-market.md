Are you planning on buying a home in this competitive market? Today, we have five tips to help you succeed and purchase a home.

We’ve put together five great tips for new homebuyers that will help up your chances of getting into your dream home.

**1. Pick a good agent.** Don’t entrust the most important purchase you will make to someone who is inexperienced or just dabbling in the industry. Find a seasoned agent who knows what to do in this highly competitive market.

**2. Get pre-approved.** Make sure you’ve gotten pre-approved by a lender before you make that offer. Along the way, find an experienced lender who will help you find the perfect programs that will help your offer look good to the seller and get you the best loan possible.

**3. Consider a home that needs work.** Homes that need work are less expensive, and the work can be done before you move in. Doing the work helps you gain equity quicker and you can make the home your own.

**4. Consider buying in a transitioning neighborhood.** In a neighborhood that’s undergoing considerable development, you may be able to buy at a lower price point, while at the same time gaining equity as that transitional neighborhood grows in value.

**5. Raise your budget.**&nbsp;Make sure you check back with your lender to see if there’s some wiggle-room in your pre-approved maximum that might put you closer to a higher price point and make you look strong to sellers. Make sure that they have you on the right loan as well. That said, always make sure that you can comfortably afford your monthly payment.
