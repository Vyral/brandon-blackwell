<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;">Don't become trapped. Rents are up 2.7% on a national level and over a quarter of renters are spending at least half of their income on rental housing, don't become trapped in that cycle. Bankrate.com recommends that only 28%&nbsp;of your pre tax income be used for housing expense.</div>

<div style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8px;">Over the long term&nbsp;it's cheaper to buy than rent. Homeownership remains cheaper than renting with a traditional 30-year fixed rate mortgage. Rents will increase but a fixed mortgage wont.</div>
