There are several things you can do to improve the air quality of your microenvironment and protect yourself against air pollution.

Today I’m joined by Daniel Mendoza, assistant research professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Utah, for a quick Q&A about our air quality along the Wasatch Front.&nbsp;

**What’s causing a lot of our air quality issues along the Wasatch Front?**

According to Daniel, there are several issues causing this problem, and they mostly relate to our geography. In Salt Lake County, we live atop a basin and we’re almost surrounded by mountain ranges, and because we also live next to the Great Salt Lake, we get lake breezes that carry pollutants into our region. Then when the wintertime inversion happens and colder air gets trapped below warmer air, it traps those pollutants that aren’t able to disperse. Since the sun isn’t giving off as much energy during this time, winds can’t pick up and simply carry those pollutants away. During the summer, the problem is slightly different. Like a majority of the American West, we sit in a high elevation, which causes ozone damage.&nbsp;

**Is there a certain time of year that’s worse than others?**

With the winter inversion happening in the colder months and ozone damage happening in the hotter months, the answer depends. Daniel himself suffers from asthma, and the summertime is significantly worse for his health. For some people, though, the wintertime PM 2.5 (i.e., fine particulate matter—an air pollutant) is actually worse for them. This summer, in particular, saw in increase in wildfires both locally and across the entire Western region, which caused extra pollution on top of the normal ozone damage. &nbsp;

**What precautions can we take during particularly bad times?&nbsp;**

There are a few common sense tips you can try. During bad winter inversions, it’s better to stay indoors, and if you must be outdoors, you can consider wearing a mask. You can also try installing HEPA filters inside your house. If you want to help out the environment as a whole, you can reduce your automobile usage by using public transportation to get to work or seeing if your employer will allow you to telecommute.

**What other things can we do to improve the air quality of the places we live in?**

There are many small behavioral changes you can make. Idling in your car while it’s running is a common one. Many people complain that if they shut off their car while waiting inside it, it becomes unbearably hot or cold, but that level of discomfort realistically takes around 10 minutes to settle in.&nbsp;

Even though air quality is a large-scale issue, you can still manage between 50% and 80% of your microenvironment, or what you and your neighbors are breathing. A great tip for this is replacing your old lawnmower with a newer or electric lawn mower.

If you’d like to know more about the air quality in your area or what you can do to improve it, you can visit the University of Utah’s website [http://air.utah.gov](http://air.utah.gov){: target="_blank"} The Division of Air Quality also offers an app called UtahAir that’s available to download for both Android and IOS phones. This app tells you with some degree of accuracy what the air quality is of the station that’s closest to you.&nbsp;

If you have any more questions for Daniel, you can email him at [daniel.mendoza@utah.edu](mailto:daniel.mendoza@utah.edu){: target="_blank"}.

If you have any more questions for me or you’re thinking about buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to call or email me anytime. I’d be happy to help you.
