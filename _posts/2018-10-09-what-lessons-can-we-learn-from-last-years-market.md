There were five main lessons we learned in 2017 that can help us make smarter home buying decisions in 2018.&nbsp;

**1. Homes are still affordable.**&nbsp;Of course, certain factors depend on the market you’re in, but homes right now are still affordable overall.&nbsp;

**2. Homes are selling quickly and are in short****supply.&nbsp;**Make sure that you work with an agent who will assist you in putting forward the best offer possible.&nbsp;

**3. House flippers are out in full force.**&nbsp;Make sure you put your highest and best offer forward first. House flippers tend to intensify the bidding process and raise the purchase price.&nbsp;

**4. Deals fall apart a lot faster than in the past.**&nbsp;In 2017, some people mistakenly believed that getting your offer accepted is the finish line of a real estate transaction. Actually, it’s just the starting line. Make sure that you know your rights as a buyer when you make your purchase in 2018.&nbsp;

**5. Buying still saves you money over renting.**&nbsp;When you rent, you’re just paying someone else’s mortgage.
