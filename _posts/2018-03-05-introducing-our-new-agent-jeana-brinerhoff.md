"I’ve been in real estate for 20 years, with 11 years as a licensed agent,” says Jeana. “I’ve processed over 700 sales, and I also have several years of title insurance and foreclosure experience. I am really excited to bring my experience and knowledge to Blackwell Realty Group. I personally chose Blackwell due to their support, mentoring, and the opportunity to grow. I look forward to establishing lifelong relationships with our clients and our agents.”&nbsp;

I want to thank Jeana for coming on board with us. As always, if you have any real estate questions, just give us a call or send us an email. We would be happy to help you!
