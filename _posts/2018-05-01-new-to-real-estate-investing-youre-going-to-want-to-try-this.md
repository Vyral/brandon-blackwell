Have you ever wanted to try your hand at real estate investing? If so, I’d like to recommend a great option that requires very little work.

Did you know that you could invest in a condo that operates like a hotel?

This is a unique style of investment that many people don’t know about, and we have a ton of these properties here in Utah.

Actually, this is an easy way for people to get into investing without doing a ton of work. All it takes is a little money and a little strategizing.

To get started, you buy a condo in a large building that operates like a hotel. When you want to use it, you simply schedule that with a management company. When you want to rent out the property instead, **the management company will advertise, find tenants, and clean the property for you, for a nominal fee.**

This style of investment allows you to have access to a great vacation home while also using the property to make supplemental income. In that way, the property helps to pay for itself.&nbsp;

These properties can be found all over Utah, whether you’re looking to invest near ski resorts, the canyons, the desert, or elsewhere. If you’re new to investing and want to give it a try without doing a ton of work, this is the best option out there. **You get a weekend getaway, and you get a little cash flow to offset its cost. &nbsp;**

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
