<p style="text-align: center;"><em>When it comes time to list, there are nine common but crucial mistakes all sellers must avoid.</em></p>

When it comes time to list, there are a nine critical mistakes all sellers must avoid. If left unaddressed, these easy-to-make errors are a surefire way to sabotage your own sale.&nbsp;

**1. Cords hanging from your TV.** &nbsp;Exposed cords from a mounted TV can make a room look messier than it is. You can either put a cover on them that matches the wall paint, or unplug them while you are showing the property or taking pictures.

**2. Unkept yard.** A lot of people drive by homes they’re interested in before scheduling a showing, and if the property has poor curb appeal, they may assume the inside is equally unkempt. &nbsp;

**3. A dingy front door.** Your front door is the first impression your potential buyers have. And since it may take their agent several seconds to open the lockbox, a potential buyer will be looking at it for a while. Taking the time to repaint your front door can really boost your curb appeal.&nbsp;

**4. Messes or odors from pets.** I know we all love our pets, but there is nothing worse than smelling someone else’s animals immediately upon entering a home. To make sure this doesn’t happen to potential buyers when they view your property, clean your carpets and light a mildly scented candle before they arrive.

**5. Cobwebs and dust.** These can make it seem as though your home hasn’t been well taken care of, so check around high corners and other out-of-the-way places in your home. Also, make sure to dust off all of your ceiling fans.&nbsp;

**6. Poor furniture arrangement.** A spacious home will almost always be a plus for potential buyers, and removing or rearranging certain furniture items can help you maximize the floor plan.&nbsp;

**7. Junk drawers.** Buyers love to check out a home’s potential storage space, so expect those touring your home to open up cabinets and drawers and prepare accordingly. The simple task of decluttering these spaces can have a major impact.

**8. Overfilled closets.** We all tend to accumulate more stuff than we need, but decluttering when you list is a must. The packing process can make this easier. Simply pack away any items you won’t be using immediately and store them elsewhere—like the garage.

**9. Cluttered countertops.** Showcasing your home in its best light means all surfaces should be free and clear of clutter, and this includes your countertops.&nbsp;
