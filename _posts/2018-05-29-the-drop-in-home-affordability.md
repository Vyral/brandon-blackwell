<p style="text-align: center;"><em>What is happening to home affordability in the marketplace, and how will it affect buyers and sellers? Here is what you need to know.</em></p>

What does the current drop in home affordability mean for you?

**The ability to afford a home is shrinking rapidly.** According to the research done by Arch Mortgage Insurance, the first quarter affordability, defined as the size of monthly mortgage payments needed for a home, has dropped by 5%. This was mainly due to the increase in mortgage rates and, to a lesser extent, an increase in home prices. As a consequence, more people are now stretched and taking on greater debt relative to their income.

Other buyers are actually being pushed out of the market altogether. Affordability is expected to drop another 15% to 20% by the end of the year. That’s because home prices continue to rise; additionally, the Fed is expected to ratchet up its reference interest rates, which often leads to mortgage interest rates, three more times this year.

What does this mean for you?

**If you’re looking to sell a home, you won’t have a hard time finding a buyer.** Even with decreasing affordability, demand for homes still outweighs supply. However, it’s certain that buyers will to take advantage of current conditions before affordability drops further. That means this spring and summer might see an additional rush in the market. This also means that right now might be a very good time to list your home if you’ve been thinking about selling for a while.&nbsp;

On the other hand, if you are thinking about buying a home, you might think this news spells doom for you. But there is no need to panic; while affordability is dropping, it is still well above historical averages, just like the current mortgage rates. In fact, Arch Mortgage Insurance estimates that homes are now 15% to 30% more affordable than they were in the period between 1987 to 2004.

At the same time, it is certainly true that mortgage rates are going up and this will affect what your mortgage payments will be on the new home.&nbsp;**From this perspective, it makes sense to act now if you’re looking to buy before the rates rise further.**
