It&rsquo;s especially important if you&rsquo;re shopping in a hot price point, like the $150,000 to $200,000 range. A pre-approval makes your offer so much stronger.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>When we&rsquo;re representing a seller and we receive an offer, we always check for a pre-approval.</strong> It lets us know that the buyer is serious and eases the seller&rsquo;s mind going forward. In order to receive a pre-approval from a lender, you&rsquo;ll need to provide them with some information. <span style="font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"><span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">This includes things like your paystubs, credit score, and other things of that nature, so keep that in mind.</span></span></span></p><h3><strong>"A good lender will help you fully understand your costs."</strong></h3><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Another huge benefit of a pre-approval is that it allows you to get an idea of what kind of home you can afford and what your actual monthly payment will be.</strong> A lot of buyers don&rsquo;t consider a lot of costs when they are shopping for loans. You'll need to be prepared for things like HOA fees or insurance costs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A good lender will always help you understand your costs and make sure you&rsquo;re fully informed throughout the process. If you have any questions for us or you&rsquo;d like a recommendation for a good lender in the area, don&rsquo;t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.</span></p><p></p>
