<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Today, I have six tips for buyers to use to get a leg up in this competitive market.</em></p>

I may be new to the Blackwell Team, but I’m not new to real estate. I’ve been selling real estate full-time for three years. Today, I want to lend you my expertise to provide some tips for the buyers who are on the market or are looking to enter it soon.

**1. Get pre-qualified.** Most homeowners are not going to accept an offer from a buyer if they haven’t been pre-qualified by a lender. Most buyers on the market are already pre-qualified anyway, so if you want to be on par with the rest of them, you need to work with a lender right away.

**2. Make a list of your needs and wants.** These are things that you can and cannot live without when you’re looking to buy a home. When you get out in the market, you’ll start seeing a ton of homes and things will get a little fuzzy. Make this list to refer back to when you start to get confused or lose perspective.

**3. Know how long you plan to stay in the home.** What are your future plans? Will you need room for growth? Will you rent it out later?

**4. Be prepared to compromise.** Whether you’re in a million-dollar price point or a $200,000 price point, it’s almost impossible to find a home that meets every checkbox unless you’re building it yourself.

**5. Make sure you have enough money set aside.** You’ll need funds for your down payment, your earnest money, inspection fees, appraisal fees, closing costs, and fees that are associated with moving.

**6. Send a personalized letter with every offer you write.** Especially with multiple offer situations, this can be the detail that sets you apart from everyone else. Tell the seller about yourself and why you’re motivated to buy the home.

I hope these tips help you win your next offer. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me anytime.
