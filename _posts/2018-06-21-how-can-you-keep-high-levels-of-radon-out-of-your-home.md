<p style="text-align: center;"><em>As a Utah homeowner, it is important that you have your home tested for radon and, if necessary, have a radon mitigation system installed on your property</em></p>

Do you know if your home has high levels of radon?

Here are how many homes, on average, test above what is considered a healthy level of radon in different areas in our market:

* Centerville: 48% 
* Farmington: 44% 
* Sugar House: 34%
* Sandy: 31%

These numbers are surprising, and they indicate why **every homeowner and homebuyer in our neck of the woods needs to test their home for radon.** 

If you are buying a home, I highly recommend that you add a radon test to your to-do list during your due diligence period. If you are not a homebuyer but you are remodeling your current home, it is a good idea to test it for radon while you are at it. 

A radon test costs between $50 and $100, but some counties and municipalities offer programs that provide them for free, so make sure you do some online research in order to find the best deal for you and your family.

**And if your home tests high for radon, have a radon mitigation system installed in it. **
