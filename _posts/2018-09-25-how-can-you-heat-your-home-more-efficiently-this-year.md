When the cold temperatures hit, your energy bills go up. Here’s how to keep them from going up too much.

As we head into the fall and winter months, I wanted to bring you a few tips to help keep your energy bills down as the weather gets colder:

**1. Use the earth as a natural heater.** During the summer months, you close your blinds to keep heat out. But during the winter and fall months, it’s a great idea to open your south-facing blinds during the day to allow the heat from the sun to enter your home.&nbsp;

2**. Insulate your windows****.** Light-colored curtains may look great in the summer, but thicker, more insulated curtains make more sense in the winter. They will keep the cold air out and keep you more comfortable in the colder weather.

**3. Check your heating system.** Getting your furnace serviced is a great idea as we head into winter. A lack of taking care of the system is one of the top causes of furnace failures. If your system is more than 10 years old, it’s a great idea to get it tuned up this year. You should also be getting your furnace filter changed each month.

**4. Turn down your thermostat.** While you’re away or sleeping, lowering your temperature 10-15 degrees will help lower your energy bills and all you have to do is sleep with a heavier blanket. Smart thermostats really come in handy here.

**5. Don’t heat unused spaces.** If there’s a room you don’t go into much, just close the door, close the vents, and push the heat to the rooms you do need to be warm.

There you have it. These are our best tips for keeping your home heated more efficiently and helping you save a little bit of money.
